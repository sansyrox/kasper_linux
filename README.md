# kasper.AI on Linux


This repository contains components to run kasper.AI on the desktop or a headless smart speaker together with the [kasper.AI Server](https://github.com/sansyrox/kasper_server). Functionalities implemented here include using the microphone to collect voice commands, converting speech to text (STT) using components such as Deep Speech, Flite, Pocket Sphinx, IBM Watson or others, controlling the volume with voice commands and providing a simple GTK interface. The ultimate goal of the project to enable users to install kasper.AI anywhere, apart from desktops and smart speakers on  IoT devices, car systems, washing machines and more.
